1. What is Django?
> Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ jang-goh) is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python. A web framework is a set of components that helps you to develop websites faster and easier.

> When you're building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc.

> Luckily for you, other people long ago noticed that web developers face similar problems when building a new site, so they teamed up and created frameworks (Django being one of them) that give you ready-made components to use.

> Frameworks exist to save you from having to reinvent the wheel and to help alleviate some of the overhead when you’re building a new site.

2. Event Purpose

> We inspire women to fall in love with programming.

[DjangoGirls homepage](https://djangogirls.org/)

Why do we want to inspire women to fall in love with programming?

> Diversity is good for a community... ...So if we want more women at conferences and in tech in general, we have to look for pragmatic solutions elsewhere.
